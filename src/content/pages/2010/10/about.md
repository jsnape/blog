![](https://jamessnape.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/jpeg.jpg?w=300)My name is James Snape and I'm an architect at Hitachi Consulting in London.

I specialise in business intelligence but have a pretty rounded set of development experiences as I've worked in broadcast media, telecoms, finance and consulting.

My current interests are agile data warehousing, functional programming and my family.
